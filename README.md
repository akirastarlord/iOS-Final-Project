The final project repository for CIS 195-201 iOS Development Fall 2019

This README file is specifically for answering the questions for Milestone 1.

"Traditional Colors Project.pdf" includes a more comprehensive introduction of the project.
"Project Progress.pdf" documents the development progress of the project.

1.
It is an app that mainly serves an educational purpose to introduce the traditional Chinese and Japanese colors to the people in the world.
Colors are an extremely important part of our lives—we see them every day, use them in every of our creations, and rely on them in describing and explaining pretty much any of the objects & things around us. However, colors are not just red, blue, green…… There are many other colors, each with a name you probably have never heard of, that are born from interesting ancient histories and potentially lie beyond your original understanding of them. Our product (app), therefore, takes the ambition of changing your perceptions on colors by sharing with you the beautiful stories behind these traditional colors, and helping you to create more values out of them.

2.
Besides incorporating most of the iOS skills we've learned in the class, I'll also use Swift web parsing & scraping, SiriKit, localization features, Navigations, UITabBars, and implement Server-local interactions.
3rd-party Cocoapods: SwiftSoup, KingFisher.
Navigation: content-driven navigation (link between different functionalities of colors)
Data model: Color, User, etc.
Frameworks / Model: 3-Tier structure, in which the processor model contains ViewControllers, WebParsers, and ColorSorters, etc.

3.
Biggest challenges will be web-parsing and (future) social networking features that involve the interactions with server and database.

4.
The app contains a virtually complete collection of traditional Chines and another collection of traditional Japanese colors.
There’s a detail page for each traditional color, containing contents such as the names, spelling, pronunciation, closest corresponding “standard” colors, the history and/or the stories that associate with it.
There’s also RGB & CMYK values presented on the detail page of each color, so that artists and designers can easily use the colors they like.
When the user first opens the app every day, the app will randomly recommend a traditional color (and its contents) in a top page news fashion.
Users can save the colors they like to their own favorite lists, and can also make notes on them.
Users can write and save journals, but it does not necessarily have to be strictly about colors.
